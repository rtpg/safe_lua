Currently, I need to implement support for unary operators


Also I should get some positioning information in the lexing tokens


Parsing of numbers is incomplete

I probably need to remove lib.rs

last time I was in the whole "get everything to parse" area

I got everything to parse, next step is to try and eval stuff

To do that I gotta:
  - fill in eval.rs' function to eval a file
  - figure out implementation of "native functions"
  - implement assert and error stuff


 Right now should just be able to run the tests to find the next steps to run

 I really should encode the position of tokens into the tokens

 I also should start looking into ways for the system to report its state.

 Instead of a test, hould make the main program be able to just run a thing.
